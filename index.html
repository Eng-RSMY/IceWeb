<p>IceWeb is a near-real-time monitoring tool used at the <a href="http://www.avo.alaska.edu/">Alaska Volcano Observatory</a> (AVO) since 1998. Its main product are <font color="#ff0000">Spectrograms</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Reduced Displacement</font> plots, which are linked to the <a href="http://www.avo.alaska.edu/internal/">AVO Internal Page.</a> <font color="#ff0000">Digital helicorder plots</font> were also part of the IceWeb system, though this feature has not been utilised since 1999 when an Earthworm helicorder module became available.</p>

<p>IceWeb was designed primarily as a tool for the AVO Duty Seismologist, to allow facilitate <strong>alarm response</strong>. Given the bandwidth limitations of dial-up modems that were commonplace at that time, static web content was the only way to go. Yet the data needed to be near-real-time, i.e. a delay of no more than 10 minutes. This would mean that by the time the Duty Seismologist received an alarm and fired up his home computer, the spectrograms and reduced displacement plots related to that alarm would be available. So there needed to be a software system at AVO that regenerated this web content every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>IceWeb also includes an <font color="#ff0000">Alarm System</font>, based on reduced displacement levels defined for each station. This sends email and pager alerts to the AVO Duty Seismologist. All IceWeb parameters, including the alarm settings for individual stations, can be configured over the web suing the <font color="#ff0000">IceWeb Setup Utility</font>. This makes IceWeb a truly web-based system. The design decision behind this was to enable the Duty Seismologist to modify alarm settings over the web in case:</p>

<ul>
<li>seismicity was escalating at a particular volcano, and the Duty Seismologist only wanted to know when a new level had been reached</li>
<li>a particular station became noisy (e.g. due to telemetry problems) and was causing false alarms to be sent</li>
</ul>

<p>While designed primarily as an alarm response system, IceWeb is also a useful laboratory tool, with many AVO staff favouring the spectrograms over traditional helicorder-style displays. A number of <font color="#ff0000">Interactive IceWeb Tools</font> were developed to enable AVO staff to generate spectrograms and reduced displacements plots for any volcano for any time period at will. An archive of daily spectrograms was also made accessible. Web-based graphical user interfaces were added as front-ends to all these tools, to allow AVO staff to run these tools remotely.</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
